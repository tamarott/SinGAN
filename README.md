### Official pytorch implementation of the paper: "SinGAN: Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image"
#### ICCV 2019 Best paper award (Marr prize)


## Random samples from a *single* image
With SinGAN, you can train a generative model from a single natural image, and then generate random samples from the given image, for example:

![](imgs/teaser.PNG)


## SinGAN's applications
SinGAN can be also used for a line of image manipulation tasks, for example:
 ![](imgs/manipulation.PNG)
This is done by injecting an image to the already trained model. See section 4 in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf) for more details.

## Code

### Install dependencies

This code was tested with python 3.6, torch 1.4. Using newer versions is likely to produce runtime errors as well as different performance.

For later torch versions, you may try this repository: https://github.com/kligvasser/SinGAN (results won't necessarily be identical to the official implementation and cpu is not an option).
#### Install python 3.6, torch 1.4 - MacOS/Linux

Install Anaconda package manager (needed, since they have correct older binaries in their repos).
On macOS (assuming you have homebrew) it can be installed with:
```
brew install --cask anaconda
```

Then:
```
conda create --name singanEnvironment
conda activate singanEnvironment
```
'activate' might produce a warning regarding shell integration, follow instructions of conda

```
conda install pytorch==1.4.0 torchvision==0.5.0 -c pytorch
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

###  Train
To train SinGAN model on your own image, put the desired training image under Input/Images, and run

```
python main_train.py --input_name <input_file_name>
```

This will also use the resulting trained model to generate random samples starting from the coarsest scale (n=0).

To run this code on a cpu machine, specify `--not_cuda` when calling `main_train.py`

###  Random samples
To generate random samples from any starting generation scale, please first train SinGAN model on the desired image (as described above), then run 

```
python random_samples.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --mode random_samples --gen_start_scale <generation start scale number>
```

pay attention: for using the full model, specify the generation start scale to be 0, to start the generation from the second scale, specify it to be 1, and so on. 

###  Random samples of arbitrary sizes
To generate random samples of arbitrary sizes, please first train SinGAN model on the desired image (as described above), then run 

```
python random_samples.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --mode random_samples_arbitrary_sizes --scale_h <horizontal scaling factor> --scale_v <vertical scaling factor>
```

###  Animation from a single image

To generate short animation from a single image, run

```
python animation.py --input_name <input_file_name> 
```

This will automatically start a new training phase with noise padding mode.

###  Harmonization

To harmonize a pasted object into an image (See example in Fig. 13 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)), please first train SinGAN model on the desired background image (as described above), then save the naively pasted reference image and it's binary mask under "Input/Harmonization" (see saved images for an example). Run the command

```
python harmonization.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --ref_name <naively_pasted_reference_image_file_name> --harmonization_start_scale <scale to inject>

```

Please note that different injection scale will produce different harmonization effects. The coarsest injection scale equals 1. 

###  Editing

To edit an image, (See example in Fig. 12 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)), please first train SinGAN model on the desired non-edited image (as described above), then save the naive edit as a reference image under "Input/Editing" with a corresponding binary map (see saved images for an example). Run the command

```
python editing.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --ref_name <edited_image_file_name> --editing_start_scale <scale to inject>

```
both the masked and unmasked output will be saved.
Here as well, different injection scale will produce different editing effects. The coarsest injection scale equals 1. 

###  Paint to Image

To transfer a paint into a realistic image (See example in Fig. 11 in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)), please first train SinGAN model on the desired image (as described above), then save your paint under "Input/Paint", and run the command

```
python paint2image.py --input_name <training_image_file_name> --ref_name <paint_image_file_name> --paint_start_scale <scale to inject>

```
Here as well, different injection scale will produce different editing effects. The coarsest injection scale equals 1. 

Advanced option: Specify quantization_flag to be True, to re-train *only* the injection level of the model, to get a on a color-quantized version of upsampled generated images from the previous scale. For some images, this might lead to more realistic results.

### Super Resolution
To super resolve an image, please run:
```
python SR.py --input_name <LR_image_file_name>
```
This will automatically train a SinGAN model correspond to 4x upsampling factor (if not exist already).
For different SR factors, please specify it using the parameter `--sr_factor` when calling the function.
SinGAN's results on the BSD100 dataset can be download from the 'Downloads' folder.

## Additional Data and Functions

### Single Image Fr√©chet Inception Distance (SIFID score)
To calculate the SIFID between real images and their corresponding fake samples, please run:
```
python SIFID/sifid_score.py --path2real <real images path> --path2fake <fake images path> 
```  
Make sure that each of the fake images file name is identical to its corresponding real image file name. Images should be saved in `.jpg` format.

### Super Resolution Results
SinGAN's SR results on the BSD100 dataset can be download from the 'Downloads' folder.

### User Study
The data used for the user study can be found in the Downloads folder. 

real folder: 50 real images, randomly picked from the [places database](http://places.csail.mit.edu/)

fake_high_variance folder: random samples starting from n=N for each of the real images 

fake_mid_variance folder: random samples starting from n=N-1 for each of the real images
